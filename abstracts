Bio: Jay works on a broad range of kubernetes enablement and go-to-market features in platform9's managed kubernetes offering, as well as doing research into various aspects of artificial intelligence and distributed storage on cloud native platforms.  He's taken on several leadership roles in engineering teams, as well as in open source foundations such as the ASF and CNCF.
Abstract: What do Kubernetes persistent volumes, certificate rotation, and API gatways all have in common?  They require alot of customization and automation for management in production applications.  By leveraging serverless frameworks, however, we can use an application level technology to manage infrastructure in a surprisingly light-weight and intuitive, yet extremely powerful manner, implementing automation around almost any cluster policy in just a few lines of type-safe, automatically executed code.  Let's hack together a serverless management plane that solves the most common Kubernetes Ops problems, in less then 30 minutes.  You'll walk away from this empowered to utilize any serverless framework at the lowest level of the stack, and in so doing, have insights into how to better utilize serverless APIs anywhwere in the stack.
